## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Out-of-sample coverage out of range | 30% | High | Walk-forward validation + recalibration |
| Overfitting on HPO trials | 15% | High | Recent period validation |
| High latency in production | 10% | Medium | Profiling + optimization |
| Conformal calibration issues | 40% | Medium | Multiple window testing |

## 📋 Decision Points

### 1. Coverage Validation (Oct 4, 12:00)
- **Question:** Proceed if coverage <87% or >93%?
- **Criterion:** Must be in [87%, 93%]
- **Action if Fail:** Mandatory recalibration
- **Decider:** Architect + Data Scientist

### 2. Production Go/No-Go (Oct 5, 12:00)
- **Question:** Deploy with current state?
- **Criterion:** 3/4 quality gates + stakeholder sign-off
- **Action if Fail:** Postpone to Oct 6
- **Decider:** PO + Architect

## 🎯 Immediate Actions Required

### For Architect/Data Scientist
1. Implement walk-forward validation script
2. Test conformal calibration windows (30, 60, 90, 120 days)
3. Register models in MLflow

### For DevOps/MLOps
1. Prepare production environment
2. Setup monitoring dashboard
3. Test deployment scripts

### For PO/Stakeholder
1. Review HPO results
2. Approve validation plan
3. Schedule final approval meeting (Oct 5)
